  abstract = {Domestic renewable energy systems, including photovoltaic energy generation, as well as local storage, are becoming increasingly popular and economically feasible, but do come with a wide range of options. Hence, it can be difficult to match their specification to specific customer’s needs. Next to the usage-specific demand profiles and location-specific production profiles, local energy storage through the use of batteries is becoming increasingly important, since it allows one to balance variations in production and demand, either locally or via the grid. Moreover, local storage can also help to ensure a continuous energy supply in the presence of grid outages, at least for a while. Hybrid Petri net (HPN) models allow one to analyze the effect of different battery management strategies on the continuity of such energy systems in the case of grid outages. The current paper focuses on one of these strategies, the so-called smart strategy, that reserves a certain percentage of the battery capacity to be only used in case of grid outages. Additionally, we introduce a new strategy that makes better use of the reserved backup capacity, by reducing the demand in the presence of a grid outage through a prioritization mechanism. This new strategy, called power-save, only allows the essential (high-priority) demand to draw from the battery during power outages. We show that this new strategy outperforms previously-proposed strategies through a careful analysis of a number of scenarios and for a selection of survivability measures, such as minimum survivability per day, number of survivable hours per day, minimum survivability per year and various survivability quantiles.},

abstract="Multi-objective optimization is an integral part of optimization activities and has a tremendous practical importance, since almost all real-world optimization problems are ideally suited to be modeled using multiple conflicting objectives. The classical means of solving such problems were primarily focused on scalarizing multiple objectives into a single objective, whereas the evolutionary means have been to solve a multi-objective optimization problem as it is. In this chapter, we discuss the fundamental principles of multi-objective optimization, the differences between multi-objective optimization and single-objective optimization, and describe a few well-known classical and evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization. Two application case studies reveal the importance of multi-objective optimization in practice. A number of research challenges are then highlighted. The chapter concludes by suggesting a few tricks of the trade and mentioning some key resources to the field of multi-objective optimization.",

abstract = "This study aimed to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based advanced thermal control method for creating more comfortable thermal environments in residential buildings. The proposed control method consisted of a thermal control logic framework with four thermal control logics therein, including two predictive and adaptive logics using ANN models, and a system hardware framework. The models were designed to achieve thermal comfort for living areas, taking into account not only air temperature, but also humidity or PMV as a control variable; and to reduce overshoots and undershoots of a control variable using ANN-based predictive and adaptive control. Incorporating IBPT (International Building Physics Toolbox) and MATLAB, a typical two-story single-family home in the U.S. was modelled for testing the performance of developed thermal control methods. Analysis revealed that ANN-based predictive and adaptive control strategies created more comfortable thermal conditions than did typical thermostat systems in terms of increased comfort period of air temperature, humidity, and PMV, and reduced over and undershoots. Thus, the proposed control methods using ANN can be concluded to have the potential for enhancing thermal comfort in residential buildings."
